## Findings and Conclusions

During this project, I could observe that API testing with Karate is highly effective and can be improved by adding more test cases. In addition, I noticed that using Postman can be of great help to perform preliminary testing before implementing automated testing with Karate.

## Findings:

Ease of test writing - Karate uses the Gherkin language, which makes it easy to write tests in a readable format for non-technical users. This enables better collaboration between development and testing teams.

End-to-end automation capability: Karate is a versatile tool that enables end-to-end (E2E) testing of APIs, covering multiple scenarios and workflows.

Integration with different data formats: Karate is able to work with different data formats such as JSON, XML and URL-encoded forms, making it easy to test APIs that handle different types of data.


## Conclusions:

Importance of test case coverage: although some test cases have been covered in this project, it is recommended to extend the coverage by adding more test scenarios. This will ensure higher reliability and quality of the APIs under test.

Continuous improvement of testing: Karate offers several features and functionalities that can be explored and leveraged to improve API testing. It is important to continue to learn and explore new ways to optimize and extend testing using Karate's capabilities.

Integration with CI/CD systems: To get the most out of API testing with Karate, its execution can be integrated into the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) processes. This will allow you to run tests automatically on each deployment and get quick feedback on API quality.

Detailed reporting: Karate generates detailed test reports, making it easy to identify issues and communicate results to team members. Reports include statistics, individual test results and screenshots, which helps in debugging and troubleshooting.
